# Welcome to Group 1
We are young talents from Boğaziçi University, taking Cmpe352&Cmpe451 courses that require us to make this great project about "Cultural Heritage".
In this project, we will develop a software that gather cultural heritage data by using crowd-sourcing technique and present all acquired data to humanity generously.
